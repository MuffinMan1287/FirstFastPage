            "content": "App Lab . We will be using App Lab on Code.org to develop a simple quiz. The lab allows us to easily use Javascript without typing, but in terms of blocks. . Outline . We will create an introduction page, and have a 3 quesiton quiz. The intro page will have a button which allows the user to go to the next question, as well as an image related to the quiz. . We plan to have our quiz be about Del Norte High School, so it could provide some uses to Del Norte students. Potential topics for quiz questions could be: . What is our mascot? | What classes are offered at DNHS? | Who is our principal? | What time does school start? | What time does school end? | When are late start days? | . Each question will have 4 answer choices, with an image or button corresponding to answer choices. If the user clicks on the button corresponding to the right answer, they will be taken to a “correct screen.” If the user gets the question wrong(clicks on an incorrect answer choice), they will be taken to an “incorrect page.” . On each “correct screen”, we plan to have an image which showcases an image of validation, and a button for the next question. On each “incorrect page”, we would have the opposite of the “correct screen”, but still a button for the next question. . After the user answers all the questions, we will take them to a final screen, which could show their score or take them to the beginning of the quiz if they want to retake it. . Plan of Screens: Home Screen -&gt; Question 1 Screen -&gt; Correct/Wrong Screen -&gt; Question 2 Screen -&gt; Correct/Wrong Screen -&gt; Question 3 Screen -&gt; Correct/Wrong Screen -&gt; Final Screen . Our Code . We utilized a lot of onEvent statements in our code, as they would let us know if a specific button has been clicked. . . Additionally, to get a score, we defined a variable and added to it every time the user selected a correct answer. . We created a variable results box, which is varied due to the display of the score. We did this since each user would have a different score. . . The playSound button adds a fun little twist, as it plays custom audio to the user after completion of the quiz. . We often looked at the code in the text form to help us build familiarity with Javascript. The debug console also helped us a lot in figuring out our mistakes, and we will use it a lot in future projects. We wonder if the debug console can be used in other languages, like Python. . The Quiz. . Here is the link to our quiz. . Our Experience . Successes, Discoveries, and Challenges . We created a quiz which was able to track the score of the user. We had some challenges defining a variable to store the score, since the syntax is different from python. We realized that we had to define the variable, and then add to it using different syntax. This is different from python because python allows the coder to keep on redefining a variable. . We also had some trouble with formatting, and centering the images and items on the screen. We learned about the pixel dimensions of the screen(it is 320 x 450 px!) We then had to use dimensions of other items on the screen to help us center the images. It was also interesting to see how the positioning system works. . What We Learned . Using AppLab was a very cool experience. It really helped us learn more about Javascript, with an easy to use interface. We liked using the blocks, but the ability to check out the code in true Javascript helped us see basic Javascript programming. This project helped us learn about user interaction and how Javascript is a powerful language for that. . We also got a preview of how to use images in Javascript. We saw the positioning system, but there still a lot to learn about how to call the shapes in real code. . Extra Project . We decided to test out other features in App Lab. We did this by creating a simple game of tic tac toe. We learned about defining variables, altering images, and even adding sound! The program allows two users to play a game of tic tac toe, and allows the user the option to reset the scoreboard without restarting the app. We also continued practicing Javascript, and using the debug console as a way to help us see where our code was going wrong.

            "content": "Changing the Fastpages Theme . The original theme of the site is minima, but I experimented with changing it to a different supported theme. It was a little confusing at first, and I realized I needed to input specific code to change the theme. . . The boxes which are around the articles seem to not have been there(with minima), and I don’t know if that was supposed to happen when changing the theme to Merlot. The preview images were very large, instead of the small ones which minima has. Also, the GitHub user button did not seem to work. It can be seen that minima is the optimized theme for Fastpages. . Customizing the Fastpage Site . I experimented with dark mode on the site, as well as changing the color of dark mode from black to a different color. It is a neat way to customize the site, but I think I will stick with the regular dark mode for now. . . Time Box Fragments . I have created a time box on the frontpage describing what I have done for the week, and linked the review ticket. . Naming and Tagging . Naming and tagging are very useful on the blog to organize material. Using the tagging feature, I have been able to organize my posts and notebooks based on the language, the subject they are for, and they week they were posted. . . Using the Searchbar . The search bar is also a powerful tool for this blog. It helps to find posts with keywords, but it also finds posts with certain tags. In the image, I was easily able to search for posts with the “week0” tag. . . Changing _config.yml . I had originally changed the config file to show the preview images, which the site did not do before. I changed show_image: to true and this allows for a different, more interesting format. . Using Liquid . I learned that liquid could make creating the time box easier. Liquid has the capability of “incrememnting” variables, or adding one each time the variable is called. I used code to do this in my table, which will make it easier to set up more additions every week. . .",

InfoDb = [] # InfoDB is a data structure with expected Keys and Values # Append to List a Dictionary of key/values related to a person and cars InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;John&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Mortensen&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;October 21&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;San Diego&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;jmortensen@powayusd.com&quot;, &quot;Owns_Cars&quot;: [&quot;2015-Fusion&quot;, &quot;2011-Ranger&quot;, &quot;2003-Excursion&quot;, &quot;1997-F350&quot;, &quot;1969-Cadillac&quot;] }) # Append to List a 2nd Dictionary of key/values InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Sunny&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Naidu&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;August 2&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;Temecula&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;snaidu@powayusd.com&quot;, &quot;Owns_Cars&quot;: [&quot;4Runner&quot;] }) # My information InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Arnav&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Kanekar&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;July 3&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;San Diego&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;**********@*****.***&quot;, # Censored &quot;Owns_Cars&quot;: &quot;None&quot; }) # Using input to add information to the dictionary InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: input(&quot;What is your first name?&quot;), &quot;LastName&quot;: input(&quot;What is your last name?&quot;), &quot;DOB&quot;: input(&quot;What is your date of birth(Month, day)?&quot;), &quot;Residence&quot;: input(&quot;Where do you live?&quot;), &quot;Email&quot;: input(&quot;What is your email?&quot;), &quot;Owns_Cars&quot;: input(&quot;What cars do you own?&quot;) }) # Print the data structure print(InfoDb) .

For Loops . Using a for loop to iterate through a list. . sports = [&quot;football&quot;, &quot;track&quot;, &quot;soccer&quot;, &quot;basketball&quot;, &quot;tennis&quot;] # list # iterates based on the range, so in this case it will only iterate 5 times for i in range(5): print(sports[i]) # would not print more than 5 sports, even if list is longer . football track soccer basketball tennis . For Loop with an Index . Creating a list and using a for loop with indexes to print it. This iterates for every index in the list, making it more powerful and easier to code with. . cake_flavors = [&quot;chocolate&quot;, &quot;strawberry&quot;, &quot;vanilla&quot;] # List # For loop, for index in list for i in cake_flavors: print(i) # Print the flavor . chocolate strawberry vanilla . Using the While Loop and Inputs . This demonstrates usage of the while loop. The while loop calls a function as long as a certain condition is met. This is also another example of creating dictionaries using inputs. . meals = {} # empty dictionary length = 4 # runs as long as there are less than 4 items in the dictionary while len(meals) &lt; length: name = input(&quot;Name a food.&quot;) rating = input(&quot;How would you rate the meal on a scale of 1 - 10?&quot;) meals[name] = rating # determines the key and the value print(meals) . {&#39;pineapple pizza&#39;: &#39;5&#39;, &#39;chicken alfredo&#39;: &#39;8&#39;, &#39;fried chicken&#39;: &#39;10&#39;, &#39;mango&#39;: &#39;9&#39;} . Recursion . Recursive functions are helpful, but can be inefficient since it keeps on recalling the function. . def factorial(i): # defining the function if i == 0: # will not recall function return 1 if i == 1: # will not recall function return i if i != 1: return i * factorial(i - 1) # recalls the function, but at lesser value print(factorial(5)) print(factorial(0)) print(factorial(1)) . 120 1 1 . Tools . Using other capabilities to organize lists. These are very useful tools. . Reverse Order . Command to output a list in reverse order. . countdown = [3, 2, 1] # New list print(countdown) countdown.reverse() # Reversing the list print(countdown) . [3, 2, 1] [1, 2, 3] . This shows that the .reverse() statement is used to reverse a list. . Sort and Set . More functions that can help to alphabetize lists as well as make sure there are no duplicates in the list. . cake_flavors = [&quot;chocolate&quot;, &quot;strawberry&quot;, &quot;vanilla&quot;] # Appending multiple items cake_flavors.append(&quot;red velvet&quot;) cake_flavors.append(&quot;lemon&quot;) cake_flavors.append(&quot;marble&quot;) print(cake_flavors) # Printing the new list # Sort function cake_flavors.sort() print(cake_flavors) # Alphabetized list # Appending more flavors cake_flavors.append(&quot;lemon&quot;) cake_flavors.append(&quot;german chocolate&quot;) cake_flavors.append(&quot;carrot&quot;) print(cake_flavors) cake_flavors = set(cake_flavors) print(cake_flavors) . [&#39;chocolate&#39;, &#39;strawberry&#39;, &#39;vanilla&#39;, &#39;red velvet&#39;, &#39;lemon&#39;, &#39;marble&#39;] [&#39;chocolate&#39;, &#39;lemon&#39;, &#39;marble&#39;, &#39;red velvet&#39;, &#39;strawberry&#39;, &#39;vanilla&#39;] [&#39;chocolate&#39;, &#39;lemon&#39;, &#39;marble&#39;, &#39;red velvet&#39;, &#39;strawberry&#39;, &#39;vanilla&#39;, &#39;lemon&#39;, &#39;german chocolate&#39;, &#39;carrot&#39;] {&#39;red velvet&#39;, &#39;carrot&#39;, &#39;marble&#39;, &#39;vanilla&#39;, &#39;german chocolate&#39;, &#39;chocolate&#39;, &#39;lemon&#39;, &#39;strawberry&#39;} . Showcases the .append(), .sort(), and set(). Append adds a new item to the list, sort puts the list in alphabetical order, and set removes any duplicatte items. . Quiz . Creating a quiz like last week, except using a list of dictionaries. This makes it easier to store questions and answers as key and value pairs. . quiz = [] # empty list #variables question_count = 5 score = 0 # appending some questions quiz.append({ &quot;What type of language is Python&quot; : &quot;object oriented&quot;, &quot;How do you get an output in Python?&quot; : &quot;print&quot; }) quiz.append({ &quot;Is a dictionary a primitive or a collection?&quot; : &quot;collection&quot;, &quot;How do you add more information to a list?&quot; : &quot;append&quot;, &quot;What do you need to call to get the value in a dictionary?&quot; : &quot;key&quot; }) # function to print questions and get answers def questioning(ask): print(&quot;Question: &quot; + ask) global ans ans = input() print(&quot;Answer: &quot; + ans) # for loop to iterate through the dictionary for dict in quiz: for question, answer in dict.items(): # for the key and value pair questioning(question) # calling function if ans.lower() == answer: score += 1 print(&quot;Your answer is correct.&quot;) else: print(&quot;You are incorrect.&quot;) # percentage calculator from last time def grade(sco, quests): percent = 100 * float(sco)/float(quests) return percent quiz_percentage = grade(score, question_count) # Defining variable print(&quot;You got &quot; + str(score) + &quot; of &quot; + str(question_count) + &quot; questions correct.&quot;) print(&quot;Your score is &quot; + str(quiz_percentage) + &quot;%.&quot;) .

Finding the secrets of .git! . Learning about bash was really interesting to see the many things it can show the user. It looks like it can be a very helpful tool. . Hacks . Is there anything we use to verify tools we install? Think about versions. . Using the bash script, we can use --version option for each of the tools to verify which version of the tool is installed. For example, executing the command python --version in bash will give us the version of python the user has installed. This helps to verify the tool that has been set up, and tells the version, so the user can know if they want to update it. Also, we can use conda list to check the programs and their versions. . Is there anything we could verify with Anaconda? . Using conda list, we can verify the programs installed. This is also useful to see what version of the program is installed. . How would you update a repository? . To update a remote repository with changes made to the local repository, we can use git push to push changes from a local repository to the remote repository. To update a local repository with changes made to the remote repository, we use git pull to pull the changes from the remote repository to the local repository. Additionally, git add and git commit are used to stage and commit changes. . Really cool would be automating a procedure from installation. . This can be done by writing and running programs using the Shell Script. .",

Question: What does a function take in? Answer: parameter Correct! Question: If the if portion of a code is not met, what runs? Answer: else Correct! You got 4 of 5 questions correct. Your score is 80.0%. . Running the quiz, we can see it can correctly see if the user types in the right answer or not. Additionally, the code correctly grades the quiz, giving both the number of questions correct and the percentage. Using the for command helps to reduce the amount of code in the program, and the use of lists helps to make this code more adaptable to changes in the question and answer list. .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting .
