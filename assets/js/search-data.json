Finding the secrets of .git! . Learning about bash was really interesting to see the many things it can show the user. It looks like it can be a very helpful tool. . Hacks . Is there anything we use to verify tools we install? Think about versions. . Using the bash script, we can use --version option for each of the tools to verify which version of the tool is installed. For example, executing the command python --version in bash will give us the version of python the user has installed. This helps to verify the tool that has been set up, and tells the version, so the user can know if they want to update it. Also, we can use conda list to check the programs and their versions. . Is there anything we could verify with Anaconda? . Using conda list, we can verify the programs installed. This is also useful to see what version of the program is installed. . How would you update a repository? . To update a remote repository with changes made to the local repository, we can use git push to push changes from a local repository to the remote repository. To update a local repository with changes made to the remote repository, we use git pull to pull the changes from the remote repository to the local repository. Additionally, git add and git commit are used to stage and commit changes. . Really cool would be automating a procedure from installation. . This can be done by writing and running programs using the Shell Script. .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting .
