    "## Explanation of Answers\n",
    "- Q3: The random number generator is unable to mock imperfections from the real world, like terrain or air molecules when rolling dice. However, it is pretty good at simulating a random selection of numbers.\n",
    "- Q4: Since this is a flight traffic simulation, it mean that it is necessary to have a simulation of other aircraft.\n",
    "- Q5: Both simulations and experiments try to have the same environment for good simulation. However, simulations may try to simplify some scenarios, to make it cheaper.\n",
    "- Q6: Simulation is probably better because it would be cheaper and safer to do. However, it may be possible to an experiment with test dummies.\n",
    "- Q7: Simulation, since the environmental group will not want to spread extra greenhouse gases. The simulation would be much easier to do.\n",
    "- Q9: You just have to calculate the average.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reflection\n",
    "Simulations help for people to learn more and predict important data which they can use to better improve algorithms and products. Simulations are often much cheaper and have no safety limits compared to real life experiments. I found these problems to be a little challenging, but a good review of simulations.\n",
