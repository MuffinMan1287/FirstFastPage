    "- It is important to pay attention to efficiencies especially when dealing with large code segments and having a limited hardware\n",
    "- Improved efficiencies make programs faster and better for users\n",
    "- Algorithms with a polynomial efficiency or slower (constant, linear, square, cube, etc.) are said to run in a reasonable amount of time \n",
