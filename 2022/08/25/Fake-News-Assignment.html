    <p><strong>Fake News Assignment</strong></p>

<p><span class="underline">Satire</span></p>

<p><em>Visiting the Onion</em></p>

<p>After checking the “About” section of the Onion, it often uses exaggerated facts, such as that it has “4.3 trillion” readers and that it is the “ single most powerful and influential organization in human history.” Additionally, in the FAQs, it states that the Onion is a satire company. When looking at the articles, the headlines appeared to be less serious and silly. Many of the articles of the Onion often use silly ideas and focus on stereotypes. In “Colleagues Give Dr. Fauci Rubella As Retirement Gift”, the author states that Dr. Fauci was given an illness which was eradicated in 2004 as a retirement gift, which is obviously a joke. This is a silly story clearly giving a satirical play on many things going on in society today.</p>

<p><em>Reading The Borowitz Report</em></p>

<p>Immediately, the website makes it clear that this is a satirical news source. As soon as the page is loaded, it states, “Satire from the Borowitz Report.” Right under this, it also says, “Not the news.”, clearly signaling that this is not real. From the headlines, it can be seen that they are very exaggerated. For example, one headline reads, “Tucker Carlson Calls Trump’s Theft of Nuclear Secrets Less Worrisome Than Hunter Biden’s Use of Joe’s Netflix Password.” This clearly pokes fun at how much Tucker Carlson likes to go after Hunter Biden, since actually stealing nuclear secrets is much more worrisome than using someone else’s Netflix password. When reading an article, a lot of the substance is based on stereotypical ideals. In “Trump Dismisses Fears That He’d Build Nukes: “I Couldn’t Even Build a Wall””, Borowitz includes multiple quotes from former President Trump which go after current President Joe Biden, stating that anything President Biden does is bad, even the good things, like building roads and microchip factories. This section of the article makes fun of the amount of hate which Trump will say about Biden. Finally, in the author’s bio, it states that Borowitz is a comedian, which helps clear up any misconception about his purpose, showing that this is a satirical website.</p>

<p><span class="underline">Researching an Article</span></p>

<p>Headline: “<em>Biden signed off on FBI review of Trump records, National Archives letter reveals</em>”</p>

<p>I found this headline on Fox News. It seemed to be going against current reports which stated that Biden had no idea about the Mar-a-Lago raid, which President Biden said in an interview. Knowing that this was from Fox News, a historically conservative and more Republican source, I wondered if this could be fake news.</p>

<p><em>Check for Credibility</em></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <blockquote>
      <p>First, I decided to check the backgrounds of the authors. Checking the authors will help me see if there are any red flags. All the authors seem to have experienced backgrounds as reporters, and have worked for other news organizations in the past.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <blockquote>
      <p>After checking the authors, I looked at the sources which the authors linked to see if there was anything credible. The links dispersed throughout the article all linked to different sites on Fox News, which does not boost the credibility.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <blockquote>
      <p>In the “About” section for Fox News, they do not mention anything about being satirical or a fake news source, which signals that they are a legitimate source.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <blockquote>
      <p>After checking the actual story, it seems to be pretty believable. However, after reading the actual letter from the NARA, it appears that Biden did in fact give the FBI to review documents which Trump had in his possession.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <blockquote>
      <p>After searching up Fox News on mediabiasfactcheck.com, I learned that Fox is a right leaning source, and has been known to spread some information related to controversies. This makes Fox News a moderately reliable source.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Conclusion: Although the article seems to be factual, it comes at a time where it can be seen as confusing or even misleading. The headline almost seems to go against current reports of Biden not knowing about the raid, but it appears in the NARA letter, Biden was fine with FBI reviewing the documents of Former President Donald Trump.</p>
