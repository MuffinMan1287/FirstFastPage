Overall, a cool experience to see what others had been working on throughout the trimester, not only in Computer Science, but other classes as well.

# Computer Science

We observed a lot of different websites from both the AP Computer Science Principles and AP Computer Science A classes. For example, we saw an APCSA project which had a random song generator. We also saw an NBA statistics site, as well as a game of Hangman.

# Animation

Looking through the 3D Animation class, we saw many interesting projects. They featured lots of donuts, but each student had their own distinct donut and background. It was really interesting.

# Art

Art is definitely something I struggle with, but I saw really cool art pieces at Night at the Museum. There were many different styles of art, and they all looked really good.

Some were pencil drawings, some were colored pencil, and some were paintings.

# Ceramics

Ceramics had many cool products to show at Night at the Museum. While creating the art may have been frustrating, the finished projects are very nice showpieces.
