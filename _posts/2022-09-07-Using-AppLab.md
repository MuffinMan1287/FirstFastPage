## App Lab

We will be using App Lab on Code.org to develop a simple quiz. The lab allows us to easily use Javascript without typing, but in terms of blocks.

## Outline

We will create an introduction page, and have a 3 quesiton quiz. The intro page will have a button which allows the user to go to the next question, as well as an image related to the quiz. 

We plan to have our quiz be about Del Norte High School, so it could provide some uses to Del Norte students.
Potential topics for quiz questions could be:
- What is our mascot?
- What classes are offered at DNHS?
- Who is our principal?
- What time does school start?
- What time does school end?
- When are late start days?

Each question will have 4 answer choices, with an image or button corresponding to answer choices. If the user clicks on the button corresponding to the right answer, they will be taken to a "correct screen." If the user gets the question wrong(clicks on an incorrect answer choice), they will be taken to an "incorrect page."

On each "correct screen", we plan to have an image which showcases an image of validation, and a button for the next question. On each "incorrect page", we would have the opposite of the "correct screen", but still a button for the next question.

After the user answers all the questions, we will take them to a final screen, which could show their score or take them to the beginning of the quiz if they want to retake it. 

Plan of Screens:
Home Screen -> Question 1 Screen -> Correct/Wrong Screen -> Question 2 Screen -> Correct/Wrong Screen -> Question 3 Screen -> Correct/Wrong Screen -> Final Screen

# Successes, Discoveries, and Challenges



# What We Learned

Using AppLab was a very cool experience. It really helped us learn more about Javascript, with an easy to use interface. We liked using the blocks, but the ability to check out the code in true Javascript helped us see basic Javascript programming. This project helped us learn about user interaction and how Javascript is a powerful language for that.
