# Page using IP

I was able to upload my flask repository and page to the IP address associated with the EC2 instance.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/workingip.png "Flask on the Web")

# Changing the page

I was also able to change something on my repository, and then push the change to the page on the IP.

Before the change:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/change2.png "No alteration")

If you look closely, you will learn to "Start with Hello!"

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/change1.png "Hello!")

It can be seen that these are both hosted on the same IP, but the pages are clearly different. It shows how easy it is to update and change a website.
