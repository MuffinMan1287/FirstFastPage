# Example 1

| Reporting Category | Student Score | Collegeboard Score | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 0 | The video and written description meets all requirements for showing and using the program. |
| Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The written response has clear information of a list and satisfies the requirements. |
| Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | The given list does not manage the complexity in this program. Also makes an error when explaining the function of code. |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 0 | Elaborates on the program and has required code segments. |
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | Explains detailed explanation of code and meets all requirements. |
| Testing | 1 | 1 | Has 3 calls to the function which do different things. |

- Differences in Program Purpose and Function: I thought the project was descriptive enough when talking about the purpose, but Collegeboard wanted a very specific explanation of the purpose.

# Example 2

| Reporting Category | Student Score | Collegeboard Score | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | The video shows user input and the code working. The written description features specific descriptions of what it does and how it is useful. There is a clearly defined function of the program. |
| Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | There are different code segments shown. There are accurate descriptions of the procedures and what is done. The list is defined and mentioned in the response.  |
| Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | The response shows how lots of data points need to be stored for the project. |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The student developed produced call different functions. There is a call of the procedure replaceList. The written response accurately describes what the procedure does |
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | The algorithm included has sequencing and selection. There is usage of an if statement to show usage of an if statement. |
| Testing | 1 | 1 | The function tests and shows proof of functionality. The video runs the code well and easily. The function has two separate calls. |

### Things to keep in mind
- Have a clear definition of program purpose
- Have an effective and quick video
- Make sure the written response has a clear description of code segments
- Use user input
