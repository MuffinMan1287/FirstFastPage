## Notes from the videos

- Stress is prominent in many places
- 

## Gratitude

While many of us strive for better, we should also take a moment to appreciate everything we have. I am very lucky to be in the circumstance which I am in.

- I am grateful for my family. They help support me in everything which I do, such as drive me to and from events. My parents and sister always help me when I am having a bad day.
- I am grateful for my teachers. The teachers who I have and have had are great teachers who constantly support my learning. I am very fortunate to be at a school where I can receive quality instruction in any class.
- I am also grateful for the resources which I am able to get. I am very lucky to be able to have a good computer, live in a good house, have 3 meals a day, and many more things.

My experience with a note of gratitude:
I gave my note of gratitude to my mom. She was very happy to receive a note of gratitude, and appreciated it a lot. It felt good to see my mom's reaction, and it made me see the importance of telling people we are thankful for them.

## Goals
Goals can help an individual feel a sense of progress. I think goals are great ways to divide up tasks, which can lead to less stress. When creating goals, I like to have more specific goals.

Goals I have:
- Sleep by 11:00 everyday
- Minimize homework on the weekend(less specific)

Goals can help us feel more organized, even we have a lot on our plate. This will help reduce stress levels in us. Especially with college application season, I think creating a list of small and specific goals related to application will allow me to be less stressed, feel more in control, and be happier.
