## Gratitude Note

## Goals
Goals can help an individual feel a sense of progress. I think goals are great ways to divide up tasks, which can lead to less stress. When creating goals, I like to have more specific goals.

Goals I have:
- Sleep by 11:00 everyday
- Minimize homework on the weekend(less specific)

Goals can help us feel more organized, even we have a lot on our plate. This will help reduce stress levels in us.
