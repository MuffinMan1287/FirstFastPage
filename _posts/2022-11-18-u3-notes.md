# Topic 3.5 Boolean Expressions
- boolean value: True or False
- We can evaluate expressions using relational operators.
    - Include equals, not equals, greater than, less than, greater than or equal to, less than or equal to
- Not Operator: will flip the result of a statement
- And Operator: both expressions have to be true to make the entire statement true
- Or Operator: Only one condition must be true to make the entire statement true

## Ideas
- Code which student needs to alter in order to result in specified boolean value
- Ask student to create code based on scenario, and display certain results.
- Display to show how code segments are evaluated.

# Topic 3.6 Conditionals
- Algorithm: finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task
- Combinations of sequencing, selection, and iteration
- Selection: allows us to choose different outcomes based on a decision or result
- if statements: act on code if the if statement is true
- if-else statement: ace on if the if statement is true, act on else if the statement is false

## Ideas
- Demonstrate examples of if statements, and how response will differ based on the conditions
- If statement in an algorithm

# Topic 3.7 Conditionals
- Nested conditional: a conditional inside of a conditional
- Can use nested conditionals in algorithms in order to to determine answers and printed statements

## Ideas
- Ask students to create an algorithm which determines something based on nested statements.
