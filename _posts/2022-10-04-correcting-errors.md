# Hacks
- Some errors which may arise in our project could be how we would store user inputs for a certain user. Storing this could be a challenge, so we would probably need to test that out.
- Some test cases could be testing user input and how the user would be displayed. We could test user storage by listing out a list of users. We could also test storing of questions and answers. We could do this by having a page which shows the list of questions and answers a user has.
- We can document bugs on the scrumboard and how we solved the problem.
- Single tests will be very useful for testing small features. We can use this as we add pieces of the program together, and then get a large, successful project.
- Things we can use single tests for: storing user input, repeating code segments which loop, and deploying the site.
